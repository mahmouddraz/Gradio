# Gradio
Building Generative AI Applications with Gradio
Want to quickly turn your ideas for potential #GENAI applications into something tangible and usable and share them with others over the web? 

DeepLearning.AI together with Hugging Face has launched another free short course on using #Gradio to very quickly create user interfaces for various LLM applications. 

In this course you will learn to: 

ðŸ¤— Create an NLP application for image to text and text to image. 


ðŸ¤— Using a pre-built Gradio chatbot to interact with different LLMs (open source like Falcon and commercial solutions like those from openAI and Google).

ðŸ¤—  A very useful feature is that you can share the application you create with others via a link hosted by Gradio, with just a single configuration parameter: demo.launch(share=True, server_port=int(os.environ['PORT2'])). 

Five notebooks are provided. You need a Hugging Face API_KEY to run the exercises. However, you can also run them on your local computer. But the notebooks are not downloadable. I have collected them all in single #Jupyterlab.
